#Titanic Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning ðŸš¢ðŸ“Š
This repository contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning project on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into factors that may have influenced survival rates on the Titanic.

##Project Objectives
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency to prepare the dataset for analysis.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate Analysis: Explore individual features (age, fare, passenger class, etc.) to understand their distributions.

##Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between variables such as age, gender, passenger class, and survival status.
Pattern and Trend Identification: Identify factors that correlate with survival outcomes, exploring how different features interact.

Key Techniques and Tools
Data Cleaning: Imputation, handling outliers, and preprocessing.

##Data Visualization: Use of Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear and insightful visualizations.
Statistical Analysis: Basic statistical measures to identify relationships between features.

Insights
This analysis provides insights into patterns in the data, such as the impact of age, class, and gender on survival, helping to reveal trends in the Titanicâ€™s passenger data.
